## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```bash
segment_profiles [path]
```

Parameters:

- `path` (optional): This should be the path to an existing `.json` file. If no path is provided, the program will generate a new `.json` file in the current directory and prompt you for user input.

Examples:

- Run without specifying a path: The program will create a new JSON file and ask for input.

```bash
segment_profiles
```

- Run with a specific JSON file path: Provide the path to an existing JSON file to use that data.

```bash
segment_profiles /path/to/your/file.json
```

For help or more details about the command-line arguments, you can run:

```bash
segment_profiles --help
```
